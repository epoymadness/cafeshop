# 🧙‍♂️ On development

I've always dreamed of owning a café—specifically, one designed for introverts. The idea came to me while I was ordering at a café one day. I always feel a bit uncomfortable standing in front of the cashier, and that sparked something.

So, I built an app. Right now, it's a mobile app, but I plan to turn it into a web app so customers can easily access the system. The concept is simple: customers order through a site, but it’s only accessible within the café. They scan something like a QR code, which connects them to the system, and from there, they can place their order—no awkward interactions needed.

Along the way, I’ve learned so many new approaches and concepts through the technologies I used to build this app. It’s not fully optimized yet, and there’s still a long way to go, but the journey has been incredibly rewarding.

This app is special to me. It’s my first personal project after grinding through the fundamentals of web development. It’s not from a tutorial hell—I built it purely from documentation and a whole lot of curiosity. And honestly? I had so much fun building it.
