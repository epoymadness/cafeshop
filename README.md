I've always found myself dreaming of having a cafe shop, a cafe shop for introverts, The idea is came from when was ordering at a cafe shop, i always feel uncomfortable
standing in front of a cashier. So I made this app, a mobile app for now, but i will turn it into a web so that customers can easily access the system. 
The customers will order thru an site, but the site is only accessible on the located cafe. the customer will scan something like qr and then it query the customer
to the system and the customer can now order.
I've learn so much approach and concepts with the technology i use to build this app, even tho it is not fully optimized.  
The journey is still on and there are so many things needs to change and learn.
I really love this app since this is my first personal project after the crazy studying of fundamentals of web. 
This is not from a tutorial hell as well and build it with documentations only, i build it with much fun.
